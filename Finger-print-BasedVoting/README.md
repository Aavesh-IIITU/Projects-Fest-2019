<h1>FINGERPRINT VOTING SYSTEM</h1>

Fingerprint Voting System is implemented with the Arduino technology.In this System a voter can poll his vote easily.In this database server all voters' information is stored to register in this system,the voter should fill a registration form with the help of a user id and password.This information will be checked by the database server.Because all the information about the voter would be already there so if anything is wrong,the system will not allow the voter to poll his or her vote.This system is helpful to the voter's as it decreases the time of voting process also.It is a more secured way of voting as it stops fake voting.
