<h1>Food Vending Machine</h1>

**INTRODUCTION:**

This project aims at construction of arduino based automated food vending machine which dispenses food in correspondence to the coin given as input.

**REQUIREMENTS:**

1.	8mm thick MDF board 
2.	Hollow Aluminium Tubes
3.	Hand Saw and blade
4.	NEMA17 Stepper Motor 
5.	Power Supply 12V
6.	Power Supply 5V
7.	Motor Driver A4988
8.	 Arduino Mega
9.	 Electronic keypad
10.	 Coil
11.	 IR Proximity Sensor
12.	 Seven segment LCD 


**CONSTRUCTION:**

A brief description of the components used in making this project is given below:

1.	NEMA 17 Stepper Motor:
The NEMA 17 is larger and generally heavier than for example a NEMA 14, but this also means it has more room to put a higher torque. It is attached to the coil which pushes the food item towards us.

2.	Seven Segment LCD:
This is used to display whether the food is dispensed or not.

3.	Arduino mega:
The Arduino Mega  is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input/output pins , 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. 

4.	IR Proximity Sensor: 
An infrared sensor is an electronic instrument that is used to sense certain characteristics of its surroundings. 
In this project they serve the purpose of coin detector. So when a coin is passed near them, it will give a positive feedback. 

6.	Motor driver:
Motor drivers are circuits used to run a motor. In other words, they are commonly used for motor interfacing. These drive circuits can be easily interfaced with the motor and their selection depends upon the type of motor being used and their ratings (current, voltage).

**CONCLUSION:**

Vending machines are convenient and they are time saver for the customers. They reduce the overhead costs by not hiring the staff as they are fully automated. 
They increase the profit. They accept credit-card or coins and they offer healthier food.
Vending machines work 24 hour a day and 365 days a year. They need neither stuff nor specialized attention.
